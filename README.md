# A repository with thousands of pre defined color presets for ReShade 
### **What is it?** <br />

LUTs (Color Lookup Table) is a baked color preset that can be used on any game that ReShade can be installed to. <br />

### **What do I need to get it working?** <br />

 [ReShade](https://reshade.me)

The <strong>_BaseLUT.fxh</strong>, <strong>ReShade.fxh</strong> and <strong>ReShadeUI.fxh</strong> files that comes with this repository.

The <strong>.fx</strong> and <strong>.png</strong> files with matching file names.

### **Installation**

[Download](https://github.com/TheGordinho/MLUT/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the repository.

Move the <strong>.fx</strong> files that you want (you don't need them all, just the ones you want) to the Shaders folder inside your reshade install folder.

Move the matching <strong>.png</strong> files to the Textures folder inside your reshade install folder.

Done! <br />

### **Tips and Tricks**

You can mix and match as many luts as you want, but be aware that you will start to see heavy color banding with 2 or more LUTs active at the same time.

Change the load order of the shader so you get diferent results.

Place the luts sandwiched between the 2 PCGI shaders to change the GI colors
