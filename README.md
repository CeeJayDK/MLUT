# A repository with thousands of pre defined color presets for ReShade

## **What is a LUT?**

LUTs (Color Lookup Table) are baked color presets you can use on any game you can install ReShade to.

## **What do I need to get it working?**

+ [ReShade](https://reshade.me)
+ The **_BaseLUT.fxh** file that comes with this repository
+ Files that come with the default reshade installation.
  + **ReShade.fxh**
  + **ReShadeUI.fxh**
+ The **.fx** and **.png** files with matching file names.

## **Installation**

1. [Download](https://github.com/TheGordinho/MLUT/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the repository.
2. Move the **.fx** files that you want (you don't need them all, just the ones you want) to the Shaders folder inside your reshade install folder.
3. Move the matching **.png** files to the Textures folder inside your reshade install folder.
4. Done!

## **Tips and Tricks**

You can mix and match as many luts as you want, but be aware that you will start to see heavy color banding with 2 or more LUTs active at the same time.

> Change the load order of the shader so you get diferent results.

> Place the luts sandwiched between the 2 PCGI shaders to change the GI colors.

> Now you can use MLUT with depth and paint the sky all the color of the rainbow \o/
